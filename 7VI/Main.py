# Creating unit tests.

# 1 Choose four distinct user stories.
## 1) As a user, I need to have the app send me a push notification not only when someone has sent me a message but also to keep me on track with my study schedule. 
## 2) As a user I want the app to be exclusive to Uni students
## 3) As a user I need to be able to send messages to other users
## 4) â€œAs a Student, I want the app to recommend potential study partners or groups based on my university program and study preferences, so that I can quickly find study partners without extensive searching.
